Question 1 (6 points). Using the SLU Majors data set, give an example of a situation where you would construct a static graph instead of an interactive graph. Why would the static graph be better?

If someone were to use a data visualization for a print article, a static graph would be the best option compared to an interactive graph. For print articles, you cannot interact with a graph on a paper and would need the static graph in order to adequately present your information.

Question 2 (17 points). Consider this version of the Tennis App from class:
```{r}
library(shiny); library(tidyverse)
atp_df <- read_csv("data/atp_matches_2019.csv")
wta_df <- read_csv("data/wta_matches_2019.csv")
both_df <- bind_rows(atp_df, wta_df)

both_long <- both_df %>% pivot_longer(c(winner_name, loser_name))

## only keep players who have player over 50 matches
both_n50 <- both_long %>% group_by(value) %>% count() %>%
  filter(n > 50)

## construct various statistics
major_tennis <- semi_join(both_long, both_n50, by = c("value"))
major_tennis <- major_tennis %>% mutate(w_svperc = 100 * w_1stIn / w_svpt,
                        l_svperc = 100 * l_1stIn / l_svpt,
                        w_firstwon = 100 * w_1stWon / w_1stIn,
                        l_firstwon = 100 * l_1stWon / l_1stIn,
                        w_secondwon = 100 * w_2ndWon / (w_svpt - w_1stIn),
                        l_secondwon = 100 * l_2ndWon / (l_svpt - l_1stIn))

major_tennis_w <- major_tennis %>% filter(name == "winner_name")
major_tennis_l <- major_tennis %>% filter(name == "loser_name")

w_small <- major_tennis_w %>% select(value, winner_seed, w_ace, w_df, w_svperc,
                                     w_firstwon, w_secondwon) %>%
  rename(seed = winner_seed, ace = w_ace, df = w_df, svperc = w_svperc,
         firstwon = w_firstwon, secondwon = w_secondwon)

l_small <- major_tennis_l %>% select(value, loser_seed, l_ace, l_df, l_svperc, l_firstwon, l_secondwon)  %>%
  rename(seed = loser_seed, ace = l_ace, df = l_df, svperc = l_svperc,
         firstwon = l_firstwon, secondwon = l_secondwon)

df <- bind_rows(w_small, l_small) %>%
  rename(player = "value")
df

var_choices <- names(df)[3:7]


library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  sidebarLayout(sidebarPanel(
    selectizeInput("playerchoice",
                   label = "Choose a Player", choices = levels(factor(df$player)),
                   selected = "Aryna Sabalenka"),
    selectizeInput("playerchoice2",
                   label = "Choose Another Player", 
                   choices = levels(factor(df$player)),
                   selected = "Aryna Sabalenka"),
    radioButtons("varchoice", label = "Choose a Statistic",
                 choices = var_choices)),
    mainPanel(plotOutput("histgraph"),
              plotOutput("boxplot"))
  )
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  
  df_sub <- reactive({
    df %>% filter(player == input$playerchoice) %>% 
      filter(player == input$playerchoice2)
  })
  
  
  hist_plot <- reactive({
    # ggplot(df_sub(), aes_string(x = input$varchoice)) +
    # geom_histogram(colour = "black", fill = "white", bins = 15)
    ggplot(df_sub(), aes(x = .data[[input$varchoice]])) +
      geom_histogram(colour = "black", fill = "white", bins = 15)
  })
  
  tennis_box <- reactive({
    ggplot(df_sub(), aes(x = .data[[input$playerchoice2]], 
                         y = .data[[input$varchoice]])) +
      geom_boxplot()
  })
  
  output$histgraph <- renderPlot({
    hist_plot()
  })
  
  ouput$boxplot <- renderPlot({
    tennis_box()
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```
Add a plot below the histogram that is a side-by-side boxplot for comparing a serving statistic of two players. The user should be able to select the two players as well as the statistic being compared.

Hint: You’ll need to create both a new input (for the second player) and a new output (for the second graph).

Hint 2: The histogram may now have data from both players. There is no need to fix this so that it only shows one player’s stats.


Two points are given for committing and pushing to GitHub.



Extra Credit (2 points). Add an input to your app that gives the user a choice for whether or not to display the means on the side-by-side boxplot (you must also modify the server so that the boxplots actually update if the user selects the means to be displayed). Below is code that plots the means on a static side-by-side boxplot.

library(tidyverse)
toy_df <- tibble(response = rnorm(100, 0, 1),
                 group = sample(c("A", "B"), size = 100, replace = TRUE))
ggplot(toy_df, aes(x = group, y = response)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", colour = "purple", shape = 8,
               size = 3)
```{r}

```
